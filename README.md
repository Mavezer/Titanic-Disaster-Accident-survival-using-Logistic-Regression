Data Cleaning
Fill the missing values
we will fill the missing values for age. In order to fill missing values we use fillna method.
For now we will fill the missing age by taking average of all age

Alternatively we will visualise the null value using heatmap
we will use heatmap method by passing only records which are null.


Precision is fine considering Model Selected and Available Data. Accuracy can be increased by further using more features (which we dropped earlier) and/or by using other model
